# This is a placeholder for relaxation music
# In a real app, you would place actual audio files here
# Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A
# 
# Example files you could add:
# - nature_sounds.mp3
# - ocean_waves.wav
# - forest_birds.ogg
# - rain_sounds.m4a
#
# For now, the app will use system sounds as placeholder
